# TODO App, Nasim Ali

What I have created is a simple TODO application using native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that'll grant users the ability to create, manage, and organize their tasks easily.

. What it includes

- Adding tasks
- Marking tasks as complete
- Deleting certain tasks
- Deleting all tasks
- Persisting data using browser's local storage
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

. How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Use the input field to add new tasks
4. Click on the checkbox to mark a task as complete
5. Click on the "Delete" button to remove a task
6. Click on the "Complete All" button to mark all tasks as completed
7. Click on the "Delete All" button to delete all tasks

   -Based on how well I think I've done, I'd give myself a score of 25 to 30 points. I made sure to do everything the assignment required and created an app that functions smoothly and has good UI. I also managed to deploy it on Netlify and GitHub. I included dynamic events as well as buttons that gives the users a shortcut into deleting all events or completing them, and made sure there aren't any errors in the code.
